Bonemeal API
============

This guide will show you how to add saplings, crops and dirt types for the
bonemeal mod to use from withhin your own mods.  Please make sure that bonemeal
appears in the depends.txt file of your mod so everything work properly.


Function Usage
==============


Adding Crops
------------

bonemeal:add_crop({ nodename_start, growing_steps, seed_name })

This command is used to add new crops for bonemeal to work on.

e.g.

bonemeal:add_crop({
	{"farming:cotton_", 8, "farming:seed_cotton"},
	{"farming:wheat_", 8, "farming:seed_wheat"},
})


Adding Saplings
---------------

bonemeal:add_sapling({ sapling_node, function, soil_type[sand, dirt, nodename] })

This command will add new saplings for bonemeal to grow on sand, soil or a
specified node type.

bonemeal:add_sapling({
	{"ethereal:palm_sapling", ethereal.grow_palm_tree, "soil"},
	{"ethereal:palm_sapling", ethereal.grow_palm_tree, "sand"},
})


Adding Dirt Decoration
----------------------

bonemeal:add_deco({ dirt_node, {grass_node_list}, {decor_node_list} })

This command will add grass and decoration to specific dirt types, use "" to
add an empty node.

e.g.

bonemeal:add_deco({"default:dirt_with_dry_grass", {"default:dry_grass_1", ""},
	{"flowers:rose", "flowers:viola"} })


Global ON_USE Function
----------------------

bonemeal:on_use(pos, strength)

This function can be called from other mods to grow plants using alternative
bonemeal items and have the same effect.

  {pos} is the location to apply growing
  {strength} is how strong to grow [low of 1 to high of 4]

Note: Higher strength items require lower light levels, and a strength of 4
needs no light at all.


Final Words
===========

I hope this guide helps you add your own plants so you can grow them quickly
with the items included.  Please check the mods.lua for more examples.
